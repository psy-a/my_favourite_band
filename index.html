      <p>
        One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band
        formed in London, England in 2010.
        <br />
        The group are composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and
        Louis Tomlinson.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        Former member Zayn Malik departed from the group in March 2015. The
        group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming
        and finishing third in the seventh series<br />
        of the British televised singing competition
        <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZWNvuA" target="_blank">The X Factor</a> in
        2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        One Direction achieved third place in the competition and immediately
        <br />after the final, their song "Forever Young", which would have been
        released<br />
        if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet.
        <br />Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been
        signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco Records record contract.

        became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their
        first four albums debut at number one. Their third album,
        <a href="https://bit.ly/2Ph0IMK" target="_blank">Midnight Memories</a>,
        was the best-selling album worldwide of 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered teen idols, One Direction were often subject to fan
        hysteria.<br />
        They have embarked on four world tours, two of which were all-stadium.
        <br />The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight Memories,<br />
        was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, the highest-grossing
        tour<br />
        by a vocal group in history and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour
        of all time, grossing $290.2 million (unadjusted for inflation).
      </p>
      <p>
        The band went on hiatus in January 2016, allowing all members to
        pursue<br />
        other projects.

      <p>
        I have never been one genre or one artist or band person, I will listen
        to any genre or artist or band as long as the music is fantastic.
        <br />
        I have favourite songs from a myriad of genres from Benga and similar
        folk songs<br />
        to rock and everything else in between.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But I came to realize there is no pne artist or band that I love almost
        every work they have ever done like I do the works of One Direction.
        Every song One Direction have done from their teen years to the present
        are great hits in my book.

          record, second time you hear it,<br />
          it’s a great record, and then the third time you hear it, it’s a
          fantastic record.<br />
          And it was a unanimous decision that it was gonna be the first single.
          It’s just a fantastically<br />
          good pop record, and it typified what the group were all about; it’s
          quirky, it’s fun, and we couldn’t have<br />
          wished for a better first record." -

    <p>Here is some of my reasons why I love One Direction;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Their music is - as the exercise put it - food for the soul. It is the
        kind of music you listen to and you find yourself singing along and
        filled with energy since they are energetic pop records.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their looks - Not only do they releast hot and amazing songs, they also
        got killer looks. If I was a girl or gay I would probably be having a
        crush on one of them, haha-haha.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are funny - Each of their videos always incorporate funny comedic
        sequences that easily keep you glued to the screen till the last second.
        They are like short movies that tell a story<br />
        on themselves and there are very few music videos that come close.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are nice, kind and respectful to their fans unlike most successful
        music artists - they have remained humble and kept off useless scandals,
        though it pains loads that they separated.<br />
        It is always uncanny that great music bands eventually break up; 1D,
        Swedish House Mafia, P-Square, just to mention a few.
