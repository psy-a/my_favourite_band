      Considered teen idols, One Direction were often subject to fan hysteria.
      They have embarked on four world tours, two of which were all-stadium.
      <br />The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight Memories, was
      the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, the highest-grossing tour by a
      vocal group in history and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all
      time, grossing $290.2 million (unadjusted for inflation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The band went on hiatus in January 2016, allowing all members to pursue
      other projects.
