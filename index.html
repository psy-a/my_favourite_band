      Considered teen idols, One Direction were often subject to fan
      hysteria. They have embarked on four world tours, two of which were
      all-stadium. 
      <br>The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight
      Memories, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, the
      highest-grossing tour by a vocal group in history and the 15th
      highest-grossing concert tour of all time, grossing $290.2 million
      (unadjusted for inflation).
      <p>The band went on hiatus in January 2016,
      allowing all members to pursue other projects.
